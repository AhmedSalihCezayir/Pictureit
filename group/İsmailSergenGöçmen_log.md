On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 26/04/2020 ~
This week I started to learn android studio and xml basics. 

### ~ 03/05/2020 ~
This week I continued to learn android studio more. I created login and register activity layouts.Also, I started to search that how we will implement Firebase to our application.

### ~ 10/05/2020 ~
This week I implement what I learned about Firebase database last week to our program which includes operations related to user account. For example creating account, login to existing account. Then I add mail verification system to register operation. Also, I added sign out layout and sign out operation to our app. In addition, this week I worked together with Ahmet to solve some crunches about authentication. Plus, I created logo for our app. 

### ~ 17/05/2020 ~
This week I studied how can we take data from firebase database so that users can see their username, displayname and email in the profile menu. Also, I rebuilded firebase database to more useful version and adapt firebase methods to this change.

### ~ 18/05/2020 ~
Today, I added necessary methods to change account's username, displayname and email.To prevent same email usage between different profiles, I added methods to check that the newly entered email is not used in another account. Also, I added password confirm system for changing email to prevent user-based mistakes. Plus, I made some visual changes.
