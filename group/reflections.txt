In this project, we learned how to develop a mobile app using Android Studio. While creating the app, we learned how to use the firebase database, firebase storage, xml and GitHub. We also learned how to work as a group. 

We learnt how to develop a whole new app. In this process, we understand that we can face multiple problems and bugs. Such knowledge can definitely help us in the following years. 

We had difficulties while learning new concepts realted to the project since some tutorials were outdated. Finding up-to-date tutorials was hard. Also, we had troubles to find bugs and solve them. Plus, sometimes Android Studio having some problems related to the file names. 

The most difficult part of the project was the start point. We did not know where to start. 

If we had a second chance, we would start earlier to work and design the structure of the project. 

For this project, we almost used 4.5 weeks to learn and implement. 

We are happy with our project since we did not know anything about android programing and we achieved our goals.
