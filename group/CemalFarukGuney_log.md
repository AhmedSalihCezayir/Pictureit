On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.


### ~ 20/04/2020 ~
I've started studying Android Studio by simply installing it and watching YouTube videos.

### ~ 27/04/2020 ~
I've continued my study. Learned how to write simple classes and interfaces with Android Studio.
Started looking and understanding the program Ahmed wrote for a headstart. 

### ~ 04/05/2020 ~
I made the buttons on the first activity work. The buttons took the user to different fragments.
Then I designed those fragments and used GridView and ImageAdapter.

### ~ 11/05/2020 ~
I've added OnItemClickListener to grid views on game fragments. Now users are able to click on 
an element of gridView and that takes them to a new fragment Ahmed has designed ViewGridItemFragment.
I've used Bundle class to specify the new fragment so that the photo user clicks and the photo on the
fragment is the same.

### ~ 18/05/2020 ~
Finished carrying tag1 and tag2 to the new fragment. 
Added the same fragment transaction future to search activity's gridView.
Now users are able to see the photo they've clicked in another fragment.
